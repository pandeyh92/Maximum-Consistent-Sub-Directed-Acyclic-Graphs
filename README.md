# Maximum-Consistent-Sub-Directed-Acyclic-Graphs

This project was part of the course B503 - Algorithm and Data Structure that I took in Fall 2015 at IUB. As, a part of this project I implemented two different algorithm to find the all possible consistent Sub DAGs of any given DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph). 

A sub DAG, H = (VH,EH) can be defined as Consistent Sub DAG for any directed acyclic graph, G = (VG) where is VG a set of	vertices and EG if VH contains entire set of parents of all nodes present in sub DAG.

Concepts used include Breadth-First search, Depth-first search, Recursion, Double Hashing and etc in Java with use of java collection as the data structure.
